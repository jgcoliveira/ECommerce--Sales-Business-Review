# 1. Business Request

Visual representation of Quarter 2 2018 Sales

User Stories:

As a Director of Sales, I want to know how much we have sold this Q2, compared to the previous year and previous Q1, so that I can know if the new marketing strategies applied this quarter have been effective. I also want which states and product categories have the most shipped orders, and if there are any trends.

As a local Sales Manager (assigned to a specific country state), I want to know about my state's sales volume, how it compares with other states and what product categories have sold the most, so that I can learn about my state's product category preferences, and share possible insights with other Sales Managers.

As a Product Specialist, I want to see how different product categories have been relating to one another on a weekly basis so that I can find any trends and colaborate with other Product Specialists on the possibility of improving product rollout
